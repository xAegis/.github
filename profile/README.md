## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

**Aegis** is a software which contains a documented lua sdk. This one has for utility the writing / reading of the memory of a Window process this one can only do it in external for the moment. Aegis is currently in version 0.1 it is all but a finished product it is necessary to envisage still much work. If you are interested in the project I encourage you to visit the documentation.
